# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: E2E Test Suite Improvement
> Created: 2025-08-11

## Overview

Implement comprehensive improvements to the e2e test suite to enhance maintainability, reliability, and performance while establishing best practices for test automation. This will create a robust, scalable testing foundation that supports continuous development and reduces technical debt.

## User Stories

### Test Data Management

As a QA automation engineer, I want consistent and isolated test data management, so that tests don't interfere with each other and provide reliable results.

**Detailed Workflow:**

- Create test data factories for users, products, and consumptions
- Implement automatic cleanup between tests
- Ensure each test has its own isolated data set
- Provide utilities for creating realistic test scenarios

### Selector Strategy Standardization

As a developer, I want a standardized selector strategy with proper data-testid attributes, so that tests are resilient to UI changes and easy to maintain.

**Detailed Workflow:**

- Establish clear guidelines for selector usage
- Add missing data-testid attributes to all components
- Replace fragile selectors with robust alternatives
- Document selector patterns and best practices

### Test Structure Optimization

As a team lead, I want well-organized, maintainable test files with proper separation of concerns, so that the test suite scales effectively and new team members can contribute easily.

**Detailed Workflow:**

- Reorganize test files into logical directories
- Implement Page Object Model pattern
- Create reusable test utilities and fixtures
- Establish consistent test naming and documentation

## Spec Scope

1. **Test Data Factory Implementation** - Create centralized test data factories with proper typing and cleanup mechanisms
2. **Selector Strategy Standardization** - Establish and implement consistent selector patterns across all components
3. **Test Structure Reorganization** - Implement Page Object Model and reorganize test files for better maintainability
4. **Configuration Management** - Consolidate timeout and environment configurations for consistency
5. **Error Handling & Reporting** - Implement retry mechanisms, better error messages, and test reporting
6. **Performance Optimization** - Reduce test execution time and improve parallel execution capabilities

## Out of Scope

- Mobile testing implementation
- Accessibility testing framework
- Test coverage reporting tools
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Cross-browser testing beyond Chromium

## Expected Deliverable

1. A fully functional e2e test suite with 95%+ pass rate and <1 minute execution time
2. Comprehensive test data management system with automatic cleanup
3. Standardized selector strategy with complete data-testid coverage
4. Well-documented Page Object Model implementation
5. Robust error handling and retry mechanisms for flaky operations
