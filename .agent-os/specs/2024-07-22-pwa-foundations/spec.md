# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: PWA Foundations
> Created: 2024-07-22

## Overview

Implement the foundational features of a Progressive Web App (PWA) to make the application installable and prepare it for future offline capabilities. This spec covers the initial setup, with full offline support to be handled in a subsequent feature.

## User Stories

### PWA Installation

As a user, I want to be able to install the application on my mobile device or desktop, so that I can access it quickly and have a more native-like experience.

The user should be prompted to install the application if their browser supports it. Once installed, the app should launch in its own window.

### Offline Indication

As a user, I want to be clearly informed when I am offline, so that I understand why some features may not be available.

When the user's network connection is lost, a persistent banner should appear at the top of the screen to indicate that they are in offline mode.

## Spec Scope

1.  **Web App Manifest**: Create a `manifest.json` file to define the application's metadata, including its name, icons, and display mode.
2.  **Service Worker**: Create and register a basic service worker to enable PWA functionality. The initial service worker will have a minimal setup, with caching strategies to be implemented in the next phase.
3.  **Offline Banner**: Implement a persistent banner that is displayed to the user when their network connection is lost.

## Out of Scope

- Full offline CRUD functionality for products, consumption, and goals.
- Data synchronization between the client and server.
- Advanced caching strategies for assets and API requests.

## Expected Deliverable

1.  The application is installable as a PWA on supported devices.
2.  A persistent banner is displayed to the user when they are offline.
3.  A basic service worker is registered and active.

## Changes

### Implementation Decisions Made During Development

#### Service Worker Refactoring (2025-08-10)

- **Decision**: Created a custom `useServiceWorker` hook instead of placing service worker logic directly in `providers.tsx`
- **Rationale**: Improved code organization, readability, and separation of concerns
- **Implementation**:
  - Created `src/hooks/use-service-worker.ts` with encapsulated service worker registration logic
  - Refactored `src/app/providers.tsx` to use the custom hook
  - Maintained all original functionality while improving code structure
- **Benefits**: Better testability, reusability, and cleaner component code

#### Dependencies Adjustment (2025-08-10)

- **Decision**: Removed `@types/dexie` dependency as dexie includes built-in TypeScript definitions
- **Implementation**: Only added `dexie` to dependencies, removed separate type package
- **Result**: Cleaner dependency management and successful installation
