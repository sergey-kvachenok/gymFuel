# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2024-07-22-pwa-foundations/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- **Web App Manifest**:
  - Create a `manifest.json` file in the `public` directory.
  - The manifest should include `name`, `short_name`, `description`, `start_url`, `display` (set to `standalone`), `background_color`, `theme_color`, and a set of icons of various sizes.
- **Service Worker**:
  - Create a `sw.js` file in the `public` directory.
  - The service worker should include basic event listeners for `install`, `activate`, and `fetch`.
  - The initial `fetch` handler will have a simple network-first strategy.
  - The service worker should be registered in the main application component, ensuring it only runs on the client side.
- **Offline Banner**:
  - Create a new React component for the offline banner.
  - The component should use the `window.navigator.onLine` property to detect the online status.
  - The banner should be displayed at the top of the page and be non-dismissible.

## External Dependencies (Conditional)

- **dexie**: `^3.2.2`
- **Justification:** While not strictly required for this foundational spec, we are including Dexie.js now to prepare for the subsequent offline support feature. It will be used for all IndexedDB interactions.
- **@types/dexie**: `^1.3.1`
- **Justification:** Type definitions for Dexie.js to ensure type safety in a TypeScript environment.
