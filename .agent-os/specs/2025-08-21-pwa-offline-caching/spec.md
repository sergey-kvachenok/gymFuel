# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: PWA Offline Caching
> Created: 2025-08-21

## Overview

Implement comprehensive offline functionality for the GymFuel PWA to cache all GET requests, ensuring users never see empty screens when opening the app while server requests are completing. The solution will follow the official Next.js PWA approach using native Next.js features with custom service worker implementation for robust caching strategies and seamless offline/online transitions.

## User Stories

### User Story 1: Offline Data Access

**As a** fitness enthusiast using GymFuel  
**I want** to view my nutrition data even when offline  
**So that** I can track my progress and view my meal history without an internet connection

**Workflow:**

1. User opens the app while offline
2. App immediately displays cached tRPC data (products, consumption history, goals)
3. User can browse their data without seeing empty screens
4. App shows offline indicator banner
5. When connection is restored, fresh tRPC data is automatically loaded

### User Story 2: Seamless Online/Offline Transitions

**As a** user with intermittent connectivity  
**I want** the app to work smoothly when switching between online and offline states  
**So that** I can use the app reliably regardless of network conditions

**Workflow:**

1. User is using the app online with fresh tRPC data
2. Network connection is lost
3. App continues to work with cached tRPC data
4. User can view all previously loaded information
5. When connection is restored, fresh tRPC data is loaded automatically

### User Story 3: Fast App Loading

**As a** user who frequently opens the app  
**I want** the app to load quickly with cached data  
**So that** I can access my nutrition information immediately without waiting for server requests

**Workflow:**

1. User opens the app
2. App immediately displays cached tRPC data from previous sessions
3. Fresh tRPC data is fetched in the background
4. UI updates smoothly when new data arrives
5. User experiences fast, responsive interactions

## Spec Scope

1. **Enhance existing service worker** (`public/sw.js`) with tRPC caching logic for `/api/trpc` requests with 24-hour TTL and 50MB cache limit
2. **Implement stale-while-revalidate strategy** for tRPC GET requests: serve cached data immediately, fetch fresh data in background, update cache with fresh data
3. **Cache static assets** using cache-first strategy: `/_next/static/` files with 7-day TTL, `/icons/` files with 30-day TTL, max 100MB total
4. **Enhance offline banner** (`src/components/OfflineBanner.tsx`) to show data freshness indicators and cache status
5. **Implement tRPC-first data strategy**: React Query cache always takes priority, service worker cache only used when offline or network fails
6. **Implement cache invalidation**: Clear service worker cache when React Query mutations update data via `queryClient.invalidateQueries()`
7. **Add cache size management**: Implement cache cleanup when storage exceeds limits, prioritize user data over static assets
8. **Handle offline navigation**: Serve cached pages for navigation requests when offline, fallback to home page if not cached

## Out of Scope

- **Offline mutations**: Users cannot create, update, or delete data while offline (will be implemented in future spec)
- **Background sync**: Automatic data synchronization when connection is restored (will be implemented in future spec)
- **Push notifications**: Offline notification capabilities (already planned for future development)
- **Advanced cache strategies**: Custom caching rules beyond the default service worker strategies
- **Cross-device sync**: Synchronization between multiple devices (will be implemented in future spec)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Fully functional offline PWA** where users can view all nutrition data without network connection
2. **Improved app performance** with faster loading times due to cached static assets and data
3. **Seamless user experience** with no empty screens or loading states when opening the app offline
4. **Robust caching system** using native Next.js PWA features that automatically manages cache size and data freshness
