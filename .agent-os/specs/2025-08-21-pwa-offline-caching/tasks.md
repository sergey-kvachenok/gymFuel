# Spec Tasks

## Task 1: Enhance Service Worker for tRPC Caching

### 1.1 Implement tRPC Caching Logic

**Requirements:**

- Enhance existing service worker (`public/sw.js`) with tRPC caching for `/api/trpc/*` requests
- Implement stale-while-revalidate strategy: serve cached data immediately, fetch fresh data in background, update cache
- Add cache-first strategy for static assets: `/_next/static/*` (7-day TTL), `/icons/*` (30-day TTL)
- Implement cache key strategy: `trpc:${userId}:${requestUrl}:${requestBody}` for tRPC requests

**Success Criteria:**

- tRPC GET requests are cached with 24-hour TTL and 50MB limit
- Static assets are cached with specified TTLs and 100MB total limit
- Service worker handles cache storage and retrieval with proper error handling
- Cache keys include user ID for data isolation

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Service worker caches tRPC GET requests with correct cache keys
- [ ] Static assets are cached for offline access with specified TTLs
- [ ] Stale-while-revalidate strategy serves cached data immediately
- [ ] Cache storage and retrieval functions with proper error handling
- [ ] Cache size limits are enforced (50MB tRPC, 100MB static)
- [ ] User-specific cache isolation works correctly

### 1.2 Add Cache Management

**Requirements:**

- Implement cache invalidation: clear service worker cache when React Query mutations update data via `queryClient.invalidateQueries()`
- Add cache size limits: 50MB for tRPC data, 100MB for static assets, prioritize tRPC data over static assets
- Implement cache cleanup: remove expired entries (older than TTL), then oldest entries when limits exceeded
- Handle cache errors: validate responses before caching, remove invalid entries, show user feedback

**Success Criteria:**

- Cache invalidation occurs within 5 seconds of React Query mutations
- Cache size stays under limits with automatic cleanup
- Cache errors are handled gracefully with user feedback
- Expired cache entries are automatically removed

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Cache invalidation triggers on React Query mutations
- [ ] Cache size limits are enforced with automatic cleanup

- Provide clear feedback about offline status and cache availability

**Success Criteria:**

- Users can distinguish between cached and fresh data with clear visual indicators
- Data freshness is clearly communicated with timestamps

## Implementation Notes

### Key Architecture Decisions

- **tRPC-first strategy**: tRPC data always takes priority over cached data
- **Service worker fallback**: Service worker cache only used when offline
- **Zero external dependencies**: Using only native Next.js features
- **Progressive enhancement**: App works without service worker for graceful degradation

### Technical Constraints

- **HTTPS requirement**: Service worker requires HTTPS in production (works on HTTP localhost in development)
- **Browser compatibility**: Must work in target browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Performance requirements**: Cache performance must not degrade app performance
- **Security requirements**: User data must be properly isolated and validated

### Integration Points

- **Existing PWA manifest**: Already configured at `public/manifest.json`
- **Existing service worker**: Enhance current `public/sw.js` with tRPC caching
- **React Query**: Integrate with existing React Query cache
- **tRPC API**: No changes to existing tRPC configuration required
