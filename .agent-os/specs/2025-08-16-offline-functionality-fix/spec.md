> Spec: Fix Offline Functionality - Complete Unified Architecture Migration
> Created: 2025-08-16

## Overview

Complete the migration to unified offline-first architecture by refactoring all React hooks to use UnifiedDataService as the single source of truth, properly initializing the background sync system, and removing all hybrid logic. This will fix the current offline functionality issues where items are not saved to IndexedDB, users can't see data offline, and there's no synchronization between IndexedDB and server.

## User Stories

### Seamless Offline Experience

As a user, I want to perform all operations (create, read, update, delete) immediately and see results instantly, regardless of my internet connection, so that I can track my nutrition without any interruptions or delays.

### Automatic Data Synchronization

As a user, when my internet connection is restored, I want the app to automatically sync all the changes I made offline to the server, so that my data is always up-to-date across all my devices without manual intervention.

### Consistent Data Visibility

As a user, I want to see the same data and have the same functionality whether I'm online or offline, so that I don't have to think about my connection status when using the app.

## Spec Scope

1. **Complete Hook Migration**: Refactor all React hooks to use UnifiedDataService as the single source of truth
2. **Background Sync Integration**: Properly initialize BackgroundSyncManager in app startup and connect to ConnectionMonitor
3. **Remove Hybrid Logic**: Eliminate all complex online/offline switching logic from components
4. **Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error handling and logging for debugging
5. **Testing**: Ensure complete offline functionality and background sync work correctly

## Out of Scope

- Server-side API changes
- Database schema modifications
- UI/UX redesign
- Performance optimizations beyond what's needed for offline functionality

## Expected Deliverable

1. All CRUD operations work immediately offline with instant UI updates
2. Background synchronization happens automatically when online
3. Consistent data visibility across online/offline states
4. Simplified codebase with reduced complexity
5. Comprehensive test coverage for all offline scenarios

## Technical Architecture

### Core Principles

1. **IndexedDB as Single Source of Truth**: All data operations go through IndexedDB first
2. **Background Sync**: Server synchronization happens in background without blocking UI
3. **Immediate Consistency**: UI always reflects the current state in IndexedDB
4. **Simplified Error Handling**: Clear error states and recovery mechanisms

### Data Flow

```
User Action → IndexedDB → UI Update → Background Sync → Server
```

### Key Components

1. **Unified Data Service**: Single service handling all data operations
2. **Background Sync Manager**: Handles server synchronization
3. **Connection Monitor**: Detects online/offline status for sync management
4. **Simplified Hooks**: React hooks that use UnifiedDataService exclusively

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Hook Refactoring (Tasks 1-3)

- Refactor useProductSearch hook
- Refactor useConsumptionsByDate hook
- Refactor useNutritionGoals hook

### Phase 2: Background Sync Integration (Tasks 4-5)

- Initialize BackgroundSyncManager in app startup
- Connect BackgroundSyncManager to ConnectionMonitor

### Phase 3: Component Updates (Tasks 6-7)

- Update ProductForm component
- Update ConsumptionForm component
- Update GoalsForm component

### Phase 4: Error Handling & Testing (Tasks 8-9)

- Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- Test complete offline functionality

### Phase 5: Cleanup & Validation (Tasks 10-11)

- Remove old hybrid logic and unused code
- Validate PWA requirements are met

## Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Refactor hooks one by one to use UnifiedDataService
2. **Phase 2**: Initialize background sync system
3. **Phase 3**: Update components to use simplified hooks
4. **Phase 4**: Add error handling and test thoroughly
5. **Phase 5**: Clean up old code and validate functionality

## Success Metrics

1. **Offline Functionality**: All CRUD operations work offline
2. **Data Persistence**: Items are properly saved to IndexedDB
3. **Background Sync**: Automatic synchronization when coming online
4. **User Experience**: Consistent behavior regardless of connectivity
5. **Code Quality**: Simplified architecture with reduced complexity
