# Spec Summary (Lite)

Fix critical bugs in PWA offline functionality where consumption submission fails offline, consumption list doesn't update, and hardcoded user IDs prevent proper data association. Focus on fixing data flow issues, removing hardcoded values, and ensuring UI immediately reflects offline changes with proper e2e test coverage.
