> Spec: Unified Offline-First Architecture
> Created: 2025-01-27

## Overview

Implement a unified offline-first architecture that treats IndexedDB as the single source of truth for all application data, with intelligent background synchronization to the server. This approach eliminates the current hybrid complexity and provides a seamless offline experience where all operations work consistently regardless of connectivity status.

## User Stories

### Seamless Offline Experience

As a user, I want to perform all operations (create, read, update, delete) immediately and see results instantly, regardless of my internet connection, so that I can track my nutrition without any interruptions or delays.

### Automatic Background Sync

As a user, I want my offline changes to automatically sync to the server in the background when I'm online, so that my data is always up-to-date across devices without any manual intervention.

### Consistent Data Visibility

As a user, I want to see the same data and have the same functionality whether I'm online or offline, so that I don't have to think about my connection status when using the app.

## Spec Scope

1. **Unified Data Layer**: Replace the current hybrid approach with IndexedDB as the single source of truth for all application data
2. **Offline-First Operations**: All CRUD operations write to IndexedDB first, then sync to server in background
3. **Intelligent Background Sync**: Implement automatic background synchronization with conflict resolution
4. **Simplified State Management**: Remove complex tRPC caching and sync queue logic
5. **Immediate UI Updates**: All operations update the UI immediately from IndexedDB

## Out of Scope

- Real-time collaboration features
- Manual sync controls
- Complex conflict resolution strategies beyond "last write wins"
- Offline analytics or reporting

## Expected Deliverable

1. All CRUD operations work immediately offline with instant UI updates
2. Background synchronization happens automatically when online
3. Consistent data visibility across online/offline states
4. Simplified codebase with reduced complexity
5. Comprehensive test coverage for all offline scenarios

## Technical Architecture

### Core Principles

1. **IndexedDB as Single Source of Truth**: All data operations go through IndexedDB first
2. **Background Sync**: Server synchronization happens in background without blocking UI
3. **Immediate Consistency**: UI always reflects the current state in IndexedDB
4. **Simplified Error Handling**: Clear error states and recovery mechanisms

### Data Flow

```
User Action → IndexedDB → UI Update → Background Sync → Server
```

### Key Components

1. **Unified Data Service**: Single service handling all data operations
2. **Background Sync Manager**: Handles server synchronization
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Simple "last write wins" based on timestamps
4. **Connection Monitor**: Detects online/offline status for sync management

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Tasks 1-4)

- Implement UnifiedDataService
- Update database schema
- Create BackgroundSyncManager
- Implement ConnectionMonitor

### Phase 2: Application Integration (Tasks 5-7)

- Update all React hooks
- Update UI components
- Implement server integration

### Phase 3: Migration & Testing (Tasks 8-10)

- Migrate existing data
- Remove old code
- Comprehensive testing
- Performance optimization

## Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Implement unified data service alongside existing code
2. **Phase 2**: Migrate all hooks to use unified service
3. **Phase 3**: Remove old offline data service and sync queue
4. **Phase 4**: Clean up and optimize

## Success Metrics

1. All offline operations work immediately
2. Background sync completes within 30 seconds of coming online
3. Zero data loss during offline/online transitions
4. Simplified codebase with 50% reduction in offline-related complexity

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Data Migration**: Implement safe migration with rollback capability
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing API during transition
3. **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive testing at each phase
4. **Rollback Plan**: Ability to revert to previous implementation if needed
