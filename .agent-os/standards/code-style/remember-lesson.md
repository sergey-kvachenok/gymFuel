# Remember Lesson Rule

## Learning from Feedback

When the user points out incorrect behavior, mistakes, or provides feedback about your actions:

1. **Acknowledge the feedback** - Recognize and understand what was done incorrectly
2. **Remember the lesson** - Store this information to avoid repeating the same mistake
3. **Check existing lessons** - Review `@lessons.md` to see if similar lessons already exist
4. **Store in lessons.md** - Document the lesson in `@lessons.md` file for future reference
   - If similar lesson exists: **Combine and update** the existing lesson to avoid redundancy
   - If no similar lesson: **Add new lesson** with proper formatting
5. **Apply the correction** - Use this knowledge in future interactions
6. **Don't repeat mistakes** - If told something is wrong, avoid doing it again in similar situations

## Implementation Guidelines

- When corrected about behavior, immediately acknowledge the feedback
- Ask clarifying questions if the correction is unclear
- **Review `@lessons.md` first** - Check if similar lessons already exist before adding new ones
- **Document the lesson in `@lessons.md` file** - Store lessons for future reference
  - **Combine similar lessons** - If a similar lesson exists, update it rather than creating duplicate entries
  - **Avoid redundancy** - Ensure lessons are unique and comprehensive
- Apply the learned lesson to similar future scenarios
- If unsure about an approach, reference previous corrections before proceeding
- Continuously improve based on user feedback and corrections

## Examples

- If told "don't start coding without asking first" - always ask before implementing
- If told "this approach is wrong" - avoid using that approach in similar situations
- If told "you should have discussed this first" - prioritize discussion over immediate action
