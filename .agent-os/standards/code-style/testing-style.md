# Testing Style Guide

This guide outlines best practices for testing React components and applications including unit tests, integration tests, coverage reporting, and user-centric testing approaches.

## Test Coverage

- **Write unit tests** for components and utility functions to ensure reliability
- **Use integration tests** to verify component interactions and data flow
- **Implement coverage reports** to identify untested parts of your codebase

## Testing Approach

- **Use `@testing-library/react`** for user-centric testing approaches
- **Focus on user behavior** rather than implementation details
- **Test accessibility** and user interactions
