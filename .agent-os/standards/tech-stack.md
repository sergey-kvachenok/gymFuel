# Tech Stack

## Front-End

The front-end is built using React 19.0.0, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Next.js 15.3.4 is the React framework used, providing server-side rendering, static site generation, and other features. Styling is handled with Tailwind CSS 4.1.11, a utility-first CSS framework, and supplemented by PostCSS 8.5.6 and Autoprefixer for enhanced browser compatibility. UI components are built using Radix UI primitives and styled with clsx and tailwind-merge for managing dynamic class names. Icons are provided by Lucide React.

## Back-End

The back-end is a serverless Next.js application. It uses tRPC 11.4.3 for creating type-safe APIs, ensuring strong type-checking between the client and server. Data is validated with Zod 4.0.5. Next-Auth 4.24.11 is used for user authentication, and bcryptjs 3.0.2 handles password hashing for security.

## Database and ORM

Prisma 6.11.1 is the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) used to interact with the database. Prisma Client automatically generated by the ORM, provides a type-safe way to query the database. The specific database type is not defined in the dependencies, but Prisma supports several options like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.

## State Management & Utilities

React Query 5.81.5 is the library for managing and caching server-side data on the client. Superjson 2.2.2 is used to serialize and deserialize data, allowing for complex data types to be passed between the client and server through the tRPC API.

## Development & Testing

The project uses TypeScript for static typing. ESLint 9 and Prettier 3.6.2 are configured for code linting and formatting, ensuring a consistent codebase. Unit testing is performed with Jest 29.7.0 and React Testing Library, with jest-environment-jsdom providing a browser-like environment for tests. End-to-end (E2E) tests are implemented using Playwright. dotenv-cli is used for managing environment variables.
