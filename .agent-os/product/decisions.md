## 2024-07-22: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

The initial product, GymFuel, will be a nutrition and calorie tracking application focused on helping users build muscle mass. The core features will include authentication, a dashboard for daily tracking, goal setting, and a history of consumption.

### Context

The primary motivation for this product is to provide a dedicated tool for fitness enthusiasts who are focused on muscle building. Existing solutions are often too general-purpose or lack the specific features needed for this target audience. The decision to build this now is based on the growing interest in fitness and nutrition tracking.

### Alternatives Considered

1.  **Build a general-purpose health app**
    - **Pros:** Wider target audience.
    - **Cons:** Less focused, more competition, would not serve the primary user persona as effectively.

### Rationale

A focused application allows for a better user experience and a more tailored feature set. By concentrating on the needs of users who want to build muscle, we can create a more effective and compelling product. The choice of a modern tech stack (Next.js, tRPC, Prisma) will enable rapid development and a high-quality user experience.

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- A clear product direction.
- A strong value proposition for the target audience.
- A solid foundation for future feature development.

**Negative:**

- A smaller initial target market compared to a general health app.
