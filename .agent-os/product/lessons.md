# Lessons Learned

This file has been split into two separate files for better organization and reusability:

## ðŸ“š Generic Lessons (Reusable across projects)

**File**: `@~/.agent-os/product/lessons-generic.md`

Contains lessons that are applicable to any React/TypeScript project:

- React and Hooks Best Practices
- Testing Best Practices
- Code Quality and Maintenance
- Data Management and Architecture
- User Experience and Feedback
- Documentation and Process
- SSR and Hydration

## ðŸŽ¯ Project-Specific Lessons (Current project only)

**File**: `@~/.agent-os/product/lessons-project-specific.md`

Contains lessons specific to this PWA/offline project:

- Authentication and User Management (project-specific)
- PWA and Offline Functionality
- SSR and Hydration (PWA specific)
- Project-Specific Data Management
- Project Documentation

## ðŸ“– How to Use

### For Generic Development:

- Reference `@~/.agent-os/product/lessons-generic.md` for general React/TypeScript best practices
- These lessons can be reused in other similar projects

### For Current Project:

- Reference `@~/.agent-os/product/lessons-project-specific.md` for PWA/offline specific lessons
- These lessons are specific to this project's architecture and requirements

### For Complete Context:

- Reference both files when working on this project
- Generic lessons provide foundational knowledge
- Project-specific lessons provide domain-specific insights

## ðŸ”„ Migration Note

All existing references to `@~/.agent-os/product/lessons.md` should be updated to reference the appropriate file based on context:

- Use `lessons-generic.md` for general development guidance
- Use `lessons-project-specific.md` for project-specific guidance
- Or reference both when comprehensive context is needed
