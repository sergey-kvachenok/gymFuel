# Lessons Learned

This file stores lessons and corrections learned from user feedback to avoid repeating mistakes.

## Implementation Workflow Lessons

### Planning Before Implementation

- **Lesson**: Never start writing code during planning or documentation creation
- **Context**: Always discuss all details, requirements, and implementation approach first
- **Action**: Ask "Should I implement the discussed functionality?" before proceeding
- **Date**: [Date when learned]

### Don't Start Coding Without Permission

- **Lesson**: Never begin implementing code when user only asks planning questions like "what's next?"
- **Context**: User asked "what's next?" and I immediately started writing User Profile code without being asked to implement anything
- **Action**: Always answer planning questions with plans/recommendations only. Wait for explicit request like "implement this" or "build the profile feature" before writing any code
- **Date**: 2025-01-27

## Code Style Lessons

### General Practices

- **Lesson**: [Add specific lessons here]
- **Context**: [When/why this lesson was learned]
- **Action**: [What to do differently next time]
- **Date**: [Date when learned]

## Communication Lessons

### User Interaction

- **Lesson**: Always clarify user intent before taking action, especially when questions could be informational vs. implementation requests
- **Context**: User asked "we still have no sw, right?" which was an informational question about current state, but I immediately started planning and implementing the service worker without being asked to do so
- **Action**: When user asks status questions like "do we have X?" or "is Y implemented?", provide a clear answer about current state and wait for explicit implementation request before proceeding with any code changes
- **Date**: 2025-08-10
