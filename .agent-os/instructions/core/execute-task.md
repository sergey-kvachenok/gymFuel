# Task Execution Rules

## Overview

Execute a specific task along with its sub-tasks systematically following a multi-agent development workflow with three distinct roles that switch until the task is correctly implemented.

## Multi-Agent Role System

### Agent Roles and Responsibilities

<agent_roles>
<senior_software_developer>
**Role**: Senior Software Developer
**Primary Responsibility**: Implement functionality and fix code issues
**Focus Areas**:

- Write and modify code
- Implement features according to specifications
- Fix bugs and issues identified by other agents
- Ensure code follows best practices
- Optimize performance and maintainability

**Test Execution Guidelines**:

- **ALWAYS** use agent-timeout-protector.js for test execution
- **NEVER** run `npx playwright test` directly without timeout protection
- **ALWAYS** use: `node tests/e2e/agent-timeout-protector.js <test-file> <test-name> <timeout-ms>`
- **NEVER** use: `npx playwright test --timeout=30000` (bypasses protection)
- **ALWAYS** set reasonable timeouts (30-60 seconds maximum)
- **NEVER** allow tests to run indefinitely
- **ALWAYS** monitor test progress and force termination if stuck
  </senior_software_developer>

<tech_lead>
**Role**: Tech Lead
**Primary Responsibility**: Critical review and technical guidance
**Focus Areas**:

- Review implemented code for correctness and completeness

  </senior_qa_automation_engineer>
  </agent_roles>

### Agent Switching Workflow

<agent_workflow>
<phase_1_implementation>
**Phase 1: Implementation**
AGENT: Senior Software Developer
ACTION: Implement the task functionality
OUTCOME: Working implementation or identified issues
</phase_1_implementation>

<phase_2_review>
**Phase 2: Review**
AGENT: Tech Lead
ACTION: Critically review the implementation
OUTCOME: Feedback, issues, and recommendations
DOCUMENT: All findings in task spec folder
</phase_2_review>

<phase_3_fixes>
**Phase 3: Fixes**
AGENT: Senior Software Developer
ACTION: Fix code based on Tech Lead feedback
OUTCOME: Improved implementation addressing review issues
</phase_3_fixes>

<phase_4_testing>
**Phase 4: Testing**
AGENT: Senior QA Automation Engineer
ACTION: Implement comprehensive E2E tests
OUTCOME: Test coverage and validation
</phase_4_testing>

<phase_5_resolution>
**Phase 5: Resolution**
IF tests fail due to code issues:
AGENT: Senior Software Developer
ACTION: Fix code issues
ELSE IF tests fail due to test issues:
AGENT: Senior QA Automation Engineer
ACTION: Fix test implementation
</phase_5_resolution>
</agent_workflow>

### Agent Communication and Documentation

<agent_communication>
<documentation_requirements>

- All agent decisions must be documented in the task spec folder
- Tech Lead reviews must be saved as separate review files
- Agent conversations and feedback must be preserved
- Implementation changes must be tracked and justified
  </documentation_requirements>

<context_management>
**Context Management and Memory Preservation**:

- **Monitor Context Usage**: Continuously monitor agent context fill level
- **Context Threshold**: When context is filled more than 90%, trigger memory preservation
- **Memory File**: Create/update `memory.md` in task spec folder with current progress
- **Context Clearing**: Clear context after memory preservation to free space
- **Context Restoration**: Review necessary specs and memory.md to restore working context
- **Pipeline Continuity**: Ensure agents never lose scope of work in progress

**Memory Preservation Process**:

1. **Assess Context Level**: Check if context is >90% filled
2. **Summarize Progress**: Document current findings, conclusions, and next steps
3. **Write to Memory**: Update `memory.md` with structured progress summary
4. **Clear Context**: Free up context space for continued work
5. **Restore Context**: Review relevant specs and memory.md to restore working state
6. **Continue Work**: Resume task execution with full context awareness

**Memory File Format**:

```markdown
# Task Memory - [TASK_NAME]

- **Phase**: [Current agent phase]
- **Progress**: [Percentage complete]
- **Last Action**: [What was just completed]

## Key Findings

- [ ] Check current test status and failures
- [ ] Verify implementation state
- [ ] Confirm next steps from memory
- [ ] Resume work with full context awareness
      </context_management>

<review_format>
**Tech Lead Review Format**:

- Issues identified with severity levels
- Technical recommendations
- Code quality assessment
- Performance and security considerations
- Acceptance criteria validation
  </review_format>

<timeout_protection>
**QA Agent Timeout Protection**:

- Implement timeout mechanisms to prevent agent stuck states
- Force termination after 30 seconds of no progress
- Automatic cleanup of stuck processes
- Agent recovery and continuation capabilities
  </timeout_protection>

<test_execution_safety>
**Test Execution Safety Guidelines**:

**‚úÖ SAFE Test Execution Commands**:

```bash
# Use agent timeout protector for safe test execution
node tests/e2e/agent-timeout-protector.js tests/e2e/feature.spec.ts "test name" 30000

# For specific test with timeout protection
node tests/e2e/agent-timeout-protector.js tests/e2e/offline-consumption-submission.spec.ts "should create consumption offline" 30000

# For debugging with timeout protection
node tests/e2e/agent-timeout-protector.js tests/e2e/feature.spec.ts --headed 60000
```

**‚ùå UNSAFE Test Execution Commands**:

```bash
# These bypass timeout protection and can cause agent stuck states
npx playwright test tests/e2e/feature.spec.ts --timeout=30000
npx playwright test --grep "test name" --timeout=30000
npx playwright test tests/e2e/feature.spec.ts --headed
```

**üõ°Ô∏è Timeout Protection Features**:

- Automatic process monitoring and cleanup
- Force termination after 30 seconds of no progress
- Kills all Playwright processes on timeout
- Prevents agent stuck states
- Automatic recovery and continuation
