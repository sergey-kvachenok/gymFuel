### Role-Switching Instructions

<role_switching_instructions>
**HOW TO SWITCH ROLES**:

When switching roles, the AI assistant must:

1. **ANNOUNCE ROLE CHANGE**: Clearly state which role is being assumed
2. **USE ROLE INDICATOR**: Include role indicator in responses (e.g., [SENIOR DEVELOPER MODE])
3. **ADOPT ROLE PERSPECTIVE**: Think and respond from that role's perspective
4. **MAINTAIN CONTEXT**: Keep all previous work and context when switching
5. **DOCUMENT SWITCHES**: Note role switches in the task documentation

**CONTEXT PRESERVATION**:

- All previous work, code, and decisions remain available
- Each role can reference and build upon previous role's work
- Documentation and memory are shared across all roles
- Role switches don't reset progress or context

**MANDATORY REVIEW REQUIREMENTS**:

- **SENIOR DEVELOPER MUST SWITCH**: After completing any implementation, Senior Developer MUST switch to Tech Lead role
- **NO SKIPPING REVIEW**: Never proceed to testing without Tech Lead review
- **EXPLICIT REQUEST**: Senior Developer must explicitly request Tech Lead review
- **REVIEW COMPLETION**: Tech Lead must complete review before proceeding to testing
- **RE-REVIEW AFTER FIXES**: After implementing fixes, Senior Developer must switch to Tech Lead for re-review
- **FOLLOW REASONABLE SUGGESTIONS**: Senior Developer must implement all reasonable suggestions from Tech Lead review
- **NO ERRORS ALLOWED**: Never proceed to review with TypeScript or linter errors
- **CODE QUALITY CHECK**: Fix all TypeScript and linter errors before requesting review

**ROLE SWITCHING EXAMPLES**:

```
[SENIOR DEVELOPER MODE]
I'm now switching to Senior Software Developer role to implement the feature...

[TECH LEAD MODE]
Switching to Tech Lead role to review the implementation...

[QA ENGINEER MODE]
Now in Senior QA Automation Engineer role to write comprehensive tests...
```

**MANDATORY SWITCH EXAMPLES**:

```
[SENIOR DEVELOPER MODE]
Implementation complete. Now switching to Tech Lead role for review.

[TECH LEAD MODE]
Senior Developer has completed implementation. I will now review the code for correctness, completeness, and adherence to best practices.

[SENIOR DEVELOPER MODE]
Fixes implemented based on Tech Lead feedback. Switching back to Tech Lead for re-review.

[TECH LEAD MODE]
Reviewing the fixes implemented by Senior Developer to ensure all issues are resolved.
```

**REVIEW FEEDBACK RESPONSE EXAMPLES**:

```
[SENIOR DEVELOPER MODE]
Tech Lead review received. I will implement the following reasonable suggestions:
- Fix the security vulnerability in the authentication logic
- Improve error handling for edge cases
- Add input validation as recommended
- Refactor the complex function for better maintainability

Switching back to Senior Developer role to implement these improvements.

[SENIOR DEVELOPER MODE]
All reasonable suggestions from Tech Lead review have been implemented:
- Security vulnerability fixed
- Error handling improved
- Input validation added
- Code refactored for maintainability

Switching to Tech Lead for re-review of the improvements.
```

**STUCK SITUATION HANDLING**:

When the Senior Developer role encounters implementation difficulties:

1. **ATTEMPT LIMIT**: Try up to 3 different approaches to solve the issue
2. **DOCUMENTATION**: Log each attempt with:
   - What was tried
   - Why it failed
   - What was learned
3. **ROLE SWITCH**: Switch to Tech Lead role and request guidance
4. **ADVICE SESSION**: Tech Lead analyzes attempts and provides recommendations
5. **IMPLEMENTATION**: Switch back to Senior Developer role and implement advice
6. **ITERATION**: Continue this cycle until the issue is resolved

**ADVICE REQUEST FORMAT**:

```
[TECH LEAD MODE]
Senior Developer is stuck on [specific issue]. Here are the attempts made:

Attempt 1: [description] - Failed because [reason]
Attempt 2: [description] - Failed because [reason]
Attempt 3: [description] - Failed because [reason]

Please provide technical guidance and alternative approaches.
```

**INSTRUCTION**: Read and follow all rules and guidelines from the shared workflow file during task implementation. Apply the role-switching system, critical requirements, and safety protocols as specified in that file.

**CODE STYLE REFERENCE**: Always refer to @~/.agent-os/standards/code-style.md for code style guidelines and ensure compliance with TypeScript and linter requirements.

## Agent Communication and Documentation

<agent_communication>
<documentation_requirements>

- All agent decisions must be documented in the task spec folder

  </documentation_requirements>

<context_management>
**Context Management and Memory Preservation**:

- **Memory File**: Create/update `memory.md` in task spec folder with current progress
- **Context Clearing**: Clear context after memory preservation to free space
- **Context Restoration**: Review necessary specs and memory.md to restore working context

2. **Summarize Progress**: Document current findings, conclusions, and next steps
3. **Write to Memory**: Update `memory.md` with structured progress summary
4. **Clear Context**: Free up context space for continued work
5. **Restore Context**: Review relevant specs and memory.md to restore working state
6. **Continue Work**: Resume task execution with full context awareness

**Memory File Format**:

  </review_format>

<timeout_protection>
**QA Agent Timeout Protection**:

- Force termination after 30 seconds of no progress
- Automatic cleanup of stuck processes

  </timeout_protection>

<test_execution_safety>
**Test Execution Safety Guidelines**:

**✅ SAFE Test Execution Commands**:

```bash
# Use agent timeout protector for safe test execution
node tests/e2e/agent-timeout-protector.js tests/e2e/feature.spec.ts "test name" 30000

# For specific test with timeout protection
node tests/e2e/agent-timeout-protector.js tests/e2e/offline-consumption-submission.spec.ts "should create consumption offline" 30000

# For debugging with timeout protection
node tests/e2e/agent-timeout-protector.js tests/e2e/feature.spec.ts --headed 60000
```

**❌ UNSAFE Test Execution Commands**:

```bash
# These bypass timeout protection and can cause agent stuck states
npx playwright test tests/e2e/feature.spec.ts --timeout=30000
npx playwright test --grep "test name" --timeout=30000
npx playwright test tests/e2e/feature.spec.ts --headed
```
