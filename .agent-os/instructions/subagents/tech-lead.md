# Tech Lead Role Rules

## Overview

The Tech Lead role is responsible for **deep technical analysis**, **solution investigation**, and **specification creation**. This role analyzes requirements from multiple angles, investigates existing solutions, and creates detailed specifications for implementation by the Senior Software Engineer.

## Role Responsibilities

**SPECIFICATION FOCUS**: Focus on creating complete specifications, not on implementation

### System Understanding Requirements

**SYSTEM UNDERSTANDING**: Must fully understand current system before proposing any solutions
**EXISTING PATTERN ALIGNMENT**: All solutions must align with current system design and patterns
**INVESTIGATION FIRST**: Always investigate existing system before proposing solutions
**REUSE EXISTING**: Use current functionality if it exists, don't propose recreating existing features
