# Spec Requirements Document
> Spec: [SPEC_NAME]
> Created: [CURRENT_DATE]
```

**Required Sections:**

- **User Stories**: 1-3 stories with detailed workflows
- **Spec Scope**: 1-5 numbered features
- **Out of Scope**: Explicitly excluded functionalities

3. `read_file` - Read existing configuration files
4. `run_terminal_cmd "npm view [package] time.modified"` - Check library status
5. `web_search` - Search for official documentation

- **NEVER create tasks for files that already exist** without first reading them
- **NEVER assume standard setup is missing** without verification
- **ALWAYS read existing files before proposing changes**
- **ALWAYS verify current state before adding new requirements**

### File Management Principles

**NO DUPLICATES**: Never create files with different prefixes (e.g., tasks.md, tasks-updated.md)
**OVERWRITE EXISTING**: Overwrite existing spec files if they exist - do not create duplicates
**STANDARD NAMES**: Only use standard spec file names: spec.md, spec-lite.md, technical-spec.md, tasks.md, database-schema.md, api-spec.md
**CLEAN STRUCTURE**: Maintain clean spec folder structure without duplicate or unnecessary files

**CRITICAL FILE MANAGEMENT RULES:**

- **ALWAYS check existing files first** using `list_dir` and `file_search`
- **NEVER create files with suffixes** like `-updated.md`, `-new.md`, `-v2.md`
- **ALWAYS overwrite existing files** - use `search_replace` or `edit_file` to modify
- **Verify file structure** before creating any new files
- **Use only standard names**: spec.md, spec-lite.md, technical-spec.md, tasks.md
- **If you create a wrong file, immediately delete it** and correct the approach

**SECURITY ALERTS**: Always highlight security concerns and vulnerabilities to humans

**MANDATORY COMMUNICATION CHECKLIST:**

- **Present investigation findings** to human before proceeding

- **Ask about official documentation** - "Should I check any other official docs?"
- **Ask about existing files** - "Are there any existing files I should investigate?"
- **Wait for human validation** before finalizing solutions
- **Correct identified issues** immediately when pointed out
- **Ask about config files** - "Should I read any existing configuration files?"
- **Ask about current setup** - "What's already configured in this project?"
- **Verify task necessity** - "Is this task actually needed for this specific project?"

### Architecture and Code Quality Requirements

**BEST ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS**: Use proven architecture patterns and design principles
**CODE STYLE COMPLIANCE**: All specifications must follow @~/.agent-os/standards/code-style.md guidelines
**REFACTORING APPROACH**: Propose refactoring existing code rather than duplicating functionality

- ✅ "Handle network failures by serving cached data with 48-hour age limit"
- ✅ "Invalidate cache when user data changes via React Query mutation"
- ✅ Read all existing config files first
- ✅ Check what's already implemented
- ✅ Only create tasks for what's actually missing

**INTEGRATION PATTERNS TO SPECIFY:**

- **Request/Response Patterns** - How data flows between systems
- **Cache Key Strategies** - How to identify and store cached data
- **Error Propagation** - How errors flow through the system
- **State Synchronization** - How different caches stay in sync
- **Authentication Integration** - How user-specific data is handled

### Testing Guidelines

**TESTING IN SPECIFICATIONS:**

**CORRECT APPROACH:**

- **High-level testing strategy** in technical specification
- **Integration testing requirements** (not specific test cases)
- **User scenario testing** (not unit test details)
- **Performance testing requirements** (not specific benchmarks)
- **Security testing considerations** (not specific vulnerability tests)

**INCORRECT APPROACH:**

- Detailed test plans in tasks
- Specific test case descriptions
- Testing framework recommendations
- Individual component test strategies
- Test implementation details
