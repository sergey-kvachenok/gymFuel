# Unified Offline-First Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the new unified offline-first architecture that replaces the current broken hybrid approach. The new architecture treats IndexedDB as the single source of truth for all application data, with intelligent background synchronization to the server.

## Problem Statement

### Current Issues

The existing offline implementation has several critical problems:

1. **Broken Callback Chain**: The `onSuccess` callback in ProductForm isn't triggering, breaking the entire caching mechanism
2. **Complex Hybrid Architecture**: The current approach tries to maintain two data sources (tRPC cache + IndexedDB) with complex synchronization
3. **Race Conditions**: Multiple data sources create timing issues and inconsistent state
4. **Poor Offline UX**: Users can't see their changes immediately due to caching delays
5. **Overly Complex Sync Logic**: The sync queue approach is error-prone and difficult to debug

### Root Cause Analysis

The fundamental problem is that the current architecture tries to maintain two separate data layers with complex synchronization logic. This creates:

- Race conditions between online/offline states
- Callback failures in the mutation chain
- Inconsistent data visibility
- Complex error handling

## Solution: Unified Offline-First Architecture

### Core Principles

1. **IndexedDB as Single Source of Truth**: All data operations go through IndexedDB first
2. **Background Sync**: Server synchronization happens asynchronously without blocking UI
3. **Immediate Consistency**: UI always reflects the current state in IndexedDB
4. **Simplified Error Handling**: Clear error states and recovery mechanisms

### Data Flow

```
User Action → IndexedDB → UI Update → Background Sync → Server
```

### Key Benefits

- **Immediate UI Updates**: All operations write to IndexedDB first, then update UI instantly
- **Simplified Architecture**: Single data source eliminates race conditions and complexity
- **Background Sync**: Server synchronization happens automatically without blocking UI
- **Better Error Handling**: Clear error states and retry mechanisms
- **Consistent Experience**: Same functionality online and offline

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

All tables (products, consumptions, nutritionGoals) include sync management fields:

```typescript
interface SyncFields {
  _synced: boolean; // Whether the record has been synced to server
  _syncTimestamp?: Date; // When the record was last synced
  _syncError?: string; // Error message if sync failed
  _lastModified: Date; // Last modification timestamp for conflict resolution
  _version: number; // Version number for optimistic concurrency
}
```

### Key Components

#### UnifiedDataService

- Handles all CRUD operations for products, consumptions, and goals
- Manages IndexedDB operations with proper error handling
- Provides consistent API regardless of online/offline status

#### BackgroundSyncManager

- Monitors online/offline status
- Queues operations for background sync
- Handles conflict resolution during sync
- Provides sync status and progress indicators

#### ConnectionMonitor

- Detects network connectivity changes
- Triggers sync operations when coming online
- Manages sync queue processing

### Conflict Resolution Strategy

1. **Timestamp Comparison**: Use `_lastModified` for conflict detection
2. **Version Checking**: Use `_version` for optimistic concurrency
3. **Last Write Wins**: Server timestamp takes precedence in conflicts
4. **Error Handling**: Failed syncs are retried with exponential backoff

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

1. **UnifiedDataService**: Single service for all data operations
2. **Database Schema**: Add sync fields and simplify structure
3. **BackgroundSyncManager**: Handle automatic synchronization
4. **ConnectionMonitor**: Detect online/offline status

### Phase 2: Application Integration

1. **React Hooks**: Update all hooks to use unified service
2. **UI Components**: Immediate updates from IndexedDB
3. **Server Integration**: Batch sync and conflict resolution

### Phase 3: Migration & Testing

1. **Data Migration**: Migrate existing data safely
2. **Code Cleanup**: Remove old complex code
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: End-to-end offline scenarios
4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize for large datasets

## Migration Strategy

### Safe Migration Approach

1. **Parallel Implementation**: Build new system alongside existing code
2. **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags to switch between implementations
3. **Data Migration**: Implement safe migration with rollback capability
4. **Gradual Rollout**: Migrate components one by one
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test each phase thoroughly

### Rollback Plan

1. **Feature Flag Control**: Ability to switch back to old implementation
2. **Data Backup**: Backup existing data before migration
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor system health during migration
4. **Quick Rollback**: Ability to revert within minutes if issues arise

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Product

```typescript
// Old approach (broken)
const createProduct = trpc.product.create.useMutation({
  onSuccess: async (newProduct) => {
    await offlineDataService.cacheServerProducts([newProduct]); // ❌ Callback fails
  },
});

// New approach (unified)
const createProduct = async (productData) => {
  // 1. Write to IndexedDB immediately
  const product = await unifiedDataService.createProduct(productData);

  // 2. UI updates instantly
  updateUI(product);

  // 3. Background sync happens automatically
  // (no user interaction required)
};
```

### Reading Products

```typescript
// Old approach (complex)
const products = isOnline ? serverQuery.data : offlineProducts;

// New approach (unified)
const products = await unifiedDataService.getProducts(userId);
// Always returns data from IndexedDB (single source of truth)
```

## Performance Considerations

### IndexedDB Optimization

1. **Efficient Indexing**: Proper indexes for common queries

By treating IndexedDB as the single source of truth and implementing intelligent background synchronization, we eliminate the complexity and reliability issues of the current hybrid approach while providing a superior user experience.

This architecture ensures that users can always interact with their data immediately, regardless of connectivity status, while maintaining data consistency and reliability through background synchronization.
